    <h2>A guide on Cheesse, its variations, and how to manage it:</h2>
    <p>Cheesse is a rare compound valued for its energy density, malleability, heat resistance, and ability to form alloys.<br>
    Cheesse is used primarily in energy production, but is also valuable in construction and aerospace.</p>

    <h2>Cheesse through history</h2>
    <p>Cheesse has been a major player throughout history, being the most valuable material on Earth and beyond. <br>
    Before the discovery of Ch-H2 fusion, Cheesse in its ore form was prized as a both a malleable but iridescent material, and as an explosive agent.</p>
    <h2>Documentation of cheesse</h2>
    <p>The first evidence of humans using Cheesse was in 1500BCE in France. A piece of jewelry was found to contain a small amount of metallic cheesse, likely an alloy.</p>

    <p>In the modern day, cheesse is used in Ch-H2 fusion reactors, which make up 71% of the world's energy prodcution. <br>
        This cheesse is radioactive and must be mined below 400 meters and modified in a processing plant.</p>
    <h2>Non-Earth Cheesse</h2>
    <p>Extra-terrestrial cheesse was first discovered by <a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer-11/in-depth/">Pioneer 11</a>, which captured an image of saturn in 1979.<br>
    Spectral analysis revealed the possibilty of Cheesse-based compounds in Saturn's rings, which was confirmed by flybys in 1980 and 81.</p>

    <p>Lunar Cheesse is a relatively recent discovery, having first been captured by NASA's <a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lunar-prospector/in-depth/">Lunar Prospector</a> in 1998.<br>
    Since then, the Constellation missions have brought back samples of Cheesse, some of which has proven useable in Ch-H2 reactors.<br>
    A planned mission in 2027 would set up mining operations for a moon-earth pipeline of cheesse.</p>
    <p>Extragalactic cheesse was first found in 2014 by Hubble, a buildup of 40% Cheesse gas nearly 5 light-years in diameter.<br>
    This has lead scientists to believe that all cheesse in the universe was brought into existence by "Cheestars", extremely dense objects where cheesse is created.</p>
    <p>An image of a significant galactic cheesse buildup in galaxy <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6872"> NGC 6872</a>, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
